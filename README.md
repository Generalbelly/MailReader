# MailReader

<p>MailReader is an app that connects with your Gmail account and allows you to sort through your emails quickly and effectively.<br>
There are three menus in this app: Unread, Bookmarks, and Trash.</p>

<p>Here's the breakdown:<br>
&nbsp;
In the Unread menu, you will see the unread emails of your inbox (Gmail account) as a card stack. From there you can swipe to either side to move your email.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you swipe it right, your email becomes bookmarked, and will move to the Bookmarks menu. You can also access the email in the 'MailReader' folder in your Gmail account (created automatically when you download MailReader).</li>
<li>If you swipe it left, your email is deleted and will move to the Trash menu.</li>
<li>You can read an email in plain text by tapping the lines icon in the navigation bar.</li>
<li>You can see the sender and subject of the email by tapping the information icon in navigation bar.</li>
<li>You can flag an email by tapping the flag icon in the navigation bar. This will hide all future emails from that sender in MailReader, but will still be viewable in Gmail.</li>
<li>If you tap a link in an email, it will open the link within the app. You can also bookmark a webpage and it will be added to your Bookmarks menu.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the Bookmarks menu, you will see emails and websites you bookmarked.<br>
If you want to delete a bookmark, swipe to the right and tap 'delete'.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>In the Trash menu, you will see emails that you have deleted.<br>
If you delete an email by accident, swipe to the right and press 'unread'. This will move that email back to the unread menu.</p>
